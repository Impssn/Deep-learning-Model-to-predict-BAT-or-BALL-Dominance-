# Deep-learning-Model-to-predict-BAT-or-BALL-Dominance
This Deep-learning ANN has a FIVE layered structure to predict weather if a Cricket match was BAT or BALL dominated.
sigmoid,relu,tanh are the various activation function used here, Mean squared error loss function, Adagrad Optimizer,
Early-stopping Regularization technique is used here. Sample user defined test cases also done.
